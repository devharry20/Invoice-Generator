# Invoice Generator

This is a full stack application I have created using Python, HTML, CSS & JavaScript. It features a beautiful landing page, a customisation page which allows the user to enter data for the invoice, including company information, client information and invoice data. Then a PDF invoice is generated, with several templates to choose from in the future.

## Examples
